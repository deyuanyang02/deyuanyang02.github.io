## Biblioshiny
This week, I finished the research about Biblioshiny, a web application that is really similar to my web app design, and write the first draft of an analysis report about this web app. I think I can learn a lot from this web app sample, including its functions, design, ideas, etc. It inspires me a lot for my project and can be a great idea to contribute to my design. I can also use Shiny environment in my web app. I'm still in the process of designing it and hopefully, I can come up with a good idea to design it. 

## Design Document
The design document is a key part of my project and my main task is to come up with a good design plan for the project. So far, I have 3 ideas to design it. The first one is to create a new database to store the funding information, but it's maybe too large to do that. Another one is to use Shiny environment and Crossref to retrieve data. Also, I'm thinking about whether I can add an additional function to Biblioshiny because its original structure is good, but we are not sure whether they accept that. 

## Lab Presentation
Other than the design and Biblioshiny, I did a lab presentation to present my work to people in the lab on Friday. I like the presentation part of my project because it is a good idea to find out my problems and get some potential solutions. I definitely got something helpful for my project.
