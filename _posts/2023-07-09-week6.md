## Revision of Design Document
Last week, I finished the first part of the design document, which is the Minimal Viable Product and four technology stacks. This part is the most important part of my project and it's the key to my research. After getting feedback from Jodi and Yuanxi, I revised the design document again with more details and critical thinking. 

## Revision of Poster
Also, I revised my poster again to make it ready to print. The contents of the poster are mostly the repetition of my design document. I tried my best to make it visually beautiful with my graphs. 

## Final paper
In addition, I start to write my final paper this week.
