## Revision of Slide for Presentation
I made and revised the slide of the last presentation. I'll talk about the how I did the project and the progress so far. 

## Final Paper
I started to draft the final paper. I plan to submit some of the paper to some conference and see whether I can present my work there or not. I'd love to present my work on different conference becuase I believe it's a great opportunity for me to share my work to others and learn about other works. 

## Code for Shiny
I also code for Shiny framework and connect my small program to Shiny to make a web application instead of a small program.

## Poster
Finally, I finished my poster and print it this week.
