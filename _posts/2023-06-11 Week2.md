## Start the research project and do research about Biblioshiny
This week, my main task is to learn about and understand Biblioshiny, a similar web application to my project. I explored the design of it and the similarity and difference between this web application and my web application. It's a really interesting project and I really enjoy it. I read the originial paper of Bibliometrix and Biblioshiny, and also the written and video tutorial of it. In order to make the process worthy, I plan to write an analysis report about Biblioshiny. I'm not sure how to write it before, so I search for the instruction of it and finish the structure of the report. Next week, I'll finish writing the analysis paper. Other than that, I finished my project plan revision and draft a prepsentation slide for next week's presentation. 

## Plan for next week

For next week, I'll finish the analysis report of Biblioshiny. I already had a basic structure of it and now I have to think about it with my research about it. Also, I'll do a presentation to the lab to show my plan and timeline for the project. I just finished the slide of it, but I'm still not quite confident about it. But I'll try to do the best. Another thing I'll do is to finish my design document for the web application. It's a short week but I finished a lot of things.
