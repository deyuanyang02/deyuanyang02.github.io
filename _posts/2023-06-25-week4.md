## Design Document
This week, I make the first draft of the design document for the web application, "WhoFundedIt." I mainly focus on the Minimal Viable Product part, which is the simplest version of the program. I think it can be a small program that will input the bibliography and output the funder information of the publication. I also make a diagram to illustrate the process.  

## Poster
Another important item I did is I finish the 0th draft of the poster of my project. I decide the structure of it and the design of the project.
