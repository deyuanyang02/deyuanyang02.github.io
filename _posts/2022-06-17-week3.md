## A Small Introduction of this week

This is the third week I come to the University of Minnesota to do the summer research. I enjoy living and studying in this school. The people are really nice and helpful there. This week, I start to do some backgroud research about the cybersickness and read many paper about this topic. This can make me know the current research of this topic and what my research should be like. At the same time, I learned the UE4 myself online.


## Some tasks I finished

During the third week of the research, I continue to learn the Unreal Engine 4. Also, I read many research paper about the topic of cybersickness.
